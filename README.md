## Snippets
Snippets for Edge, Japa, and AdonisJS are defined, take a look [here](./snippets/) to see the list of snippets.

_Since I'm not a big snippet user, feel free to propose a PR with snippets you think are useful._


# Configuration

- `nodePath`: The path to the node executable.
- `useUnixCd`: Use Unix-style cd for windows terminals ( Useful when using Cygwin or Git Bash )
- `quickJump`: Enable quick jump by using Ctrl + Click

# Known Issues
Below is the list of unsupported features (for the moment), feel free to make a PR if you want them to be delivered faster: 
- Edge Links Provider for [Component as tags](https://docs.adonisjs.com/guides/views/components#components-as-tags)
- Edge Links Provider for `@includeIf` tag

## IntelliSense while typing
In the context of controller and view autocompletion, we are inside strings. By default, VSCode totally disables the display of IntelliSense suggestions inside strings. So if you want to see the autocompletion of your controllers and views, you will have to press CTRL+Space to manually trigger IntelliSense.

If you want the suggestions while typing, you can add this to your VSCode configuration :

```json
"editor.quickSuggestions": {
  "other": "off",
  "comments": "off",
  "strings": "on" ðŸ‘ˆ // This
}
```

But be warned, this will automatically display intellisense even in "traditional" strings

## Emmet doesn't working in edge files
Just add this in your VSCode settings : 
```json
"emmet.includeLanguages": {
  "edge": "html"
}
```
