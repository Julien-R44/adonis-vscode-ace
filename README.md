## Snippets
Snippets for Edge and AdonisJS are defined, take a look [here](./snippets/) to see the list of snippets.

_Since I'm not a big snippet user, feel free to propose a PR with snippets you think are useful._


# Configuration

- `nodePath`: The path to the node executable.
- `useUnixCd`: Use Unix-style `cd` for windows terminals (Useful when using Cygwin or Git Bash)
- `quickJump`: Enable quick jump by using <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>Click</kbd>
- `runMigrationInBackground`: Run migration/seeds commands in background. By default, they are executed in the built-in terminal of VSCode so that you can see the output.

# Known Issues
Below is the list of unsupported features (for the moment) by the extension, feel free to make a PR if you'd like to contribute to the project: 
- Edge Links Provider for [Component as tags](https://docs.adonisjs.com/guides/views/components#components-as-tags)
- Edge Links Provider for `@includeIf` tag

## IntelliSense while typing
In the context of controller and view autocompletion, we are inside strings. By default, VSCode totally disables the display of IntelliSense suggestions inside strings. If you want to see the autocompletion of your controllers and views, you will have to press <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>Space</kbd> to manually trigger IntelliSense.

If you want the suggestions while typing, you can add this to your VSCode settings:

```json
"editor.quickSuggestions": {
  "other": "off",
  "comments": "off",
  "strings": "on" ðŸ‘ˆ // This
}
```

But be warned, this will automatically display intellisense even in "traditional" strings

## Emmet doesn't work in Edge files

Just add this in your VSCode settings: 
```json
"emmet.includeLanguages": {
  "edge": "html"
}
```
